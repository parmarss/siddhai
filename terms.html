      <p class="text-muted">Last updated: 18th Jan 2026</p>

      <p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Siddh.ai (and any present/future subdomains) and the Lawraj services made available through these websites (the “Platform”).</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a binding agreement between you (“you”, “User”) and <strong>Lawraj Private Limited</strong> (“Lawraj”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>
      
      <p>These Terms are an electronic record under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and do not require physical or digital signatures.</p>

      <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Account”</strong> means the user account registered on the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>“Customer Content”</strong> means documents, text, and other content you upload, submit, or store on the Platform (including any case inputs and saved cases).</li>

        <li><strong>“Enterprise Terms”</strong> means a separate Order Form / MSA / DPA executed between Lawraj and an enterprise customer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. About the Platform</h2>
      <p>Lawraj provides tools that transform complex judicial proceedings into easier-to-understand indicators and insights for users, based on Public Records and information you provide.</p>
      <p><strong>Current coverage:</strong> The Plans currently cover <strong>Supreme Court of India matters</strong> only (as stated on the pricing page).</p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> to use the Platform. By using the Platform, you represent that you meet this requirement.</p>

      <h2>4. Account registration and security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account required:</strong> You must create an Account to use the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We currently support login via OTP to mobile number and/or email. We may introduce additional login methods later.</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate information:</strong> You agree to provide accurate, current information and keep it updated.</li>
        <li><strong>No account sharing:</strong> Your Account is personal to you. You must not share, transfer, or permit others to use your Account credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Your responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for all activity under your Account. Notify us promptly if you suspect unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Plans, access limits, and “Fair Usage”</h2>
      
      <h3>5.1 Plans and plan features</h3>
      <p>Your access depends on the Plan you purchase. Current Plans include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free 7-day Preview:</strong> masked lawyer profiles; certain details locked.</li>
        <li><strong>Lawyer Packs:</strong> unlock 1 or 3 shortlisted lawyers; credits expire 14 days after unlock.</li>
        <li><strong>30 Day Plan:</strong> full access for 1 matter; single user; no advanced filters.</li>
        <li><strong>Team:</strong> subscription; seats and matters per month; admin controls; GST invoices; top-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> custom annual contracts; governed by Enterprise Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 One matter / one case restriction (30 Day Plan)</h3>
      <p>Where a Plan is limited to one matter/case, you will be required to enter case-related inputs. Once submitted, you <strong>cannot edit or replace</strong> the case inputs for that Plan. Attempts to circumvent this limitation may result in suspension.</p>
      <p>We may, at our sole discretion, allow a one-time correction for genuine data entry errors (e.g., typos) if reported within 24 hours. This is not a refund entitlement and does not allow changing the matter type to view different lawyers.</p>

      <h3>5.3 Seat limits (Team)</h3>
      <p>If your Plan includes multiple seats, each seat must be used by a distinct individual. Sharing credentials across users is prohibited.</p>

      <h3>5.4 Fair Usage</h3>
      <p>Fair usage limits apply on all Plans. You agree not to use the Platform in a way that imposes unreasonable load or is inconsistent with normal usage. We may throttle or restrict access for excessive usage.</p>

      <h2>6. Payments, billing, renewals, and taxes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Plan pricing is listed on the pricing page.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> Payments are processed by third-party payment partners. We do not store full card numbers or CVV.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-renewal (Team):</strong> If your Team Plan is a recurring subscription, it may renew automatically unless you cancel. You authorize us and our partners to process recurring payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>No refunds:</strong> Except where required by law, fees are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds for partial periods or unused usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Taxes (GST):</strong> Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Lawyer profiles and profile claims</h2>
      <p>The Platform may display lawyer profiles based on Public Records. Display of a profile does not constitute endorsement by Lawraj.</p>
      <p>Lawyers may request to claim their profile and verify details. A claimed-profile lawyer may request correction of inaccurate details or mapping errors, subject to verification.</p>

      <h2>8. Customer Content (uploads)</h2>
      <h3>8.1 Your responsibilities</h3>
      <p>You are solely responsible for your Customer Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to upload it and that it does not violate any law or confidentiality obligation. <strong>Important:</strong> Do not upload information protected by attorney-client privilege unless you are authorized to share it.</p>

      <h3>8.2 Prohibited uploads</h3>
      <p>You must not upload content that is unlawful to publish, including content that identifies sexual offence victims or juveniles in a prohibited manner. You must redact such information before uploading.</p>

      <h3>8.3 License to process Customer Content</h3>
      <p>You retain ownership of your Customer Content. You grant Lawraj a license to host, process, and analyze it solely to provide the Platform, improve services, comply with law, and support you.</p>

      <h3>8.4 Notice and takedown</h3>
      <p>If we become aware that Customer Content violates law or these Terms, we may remove or restrict it. To report unlawful content, contact <a href="mailto:support@siddh.ai">support@siddh.ai</a> or <a href="mailto:privacy@siddh.ai">privacy@siddh.ai</a>.</p>

      <h2>9. Public Records and correction/removal requests</h2>
      <p>We do not control the content of court records sourced from official portals. If you believe a record is inaccurate, you may request correction. We may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Correct verifiable errors;</li>
        <li>Limit display, de-index, or anonymize identifiers where appropriate;</li>
        <li>Comply with valid court orders requiring removal or redaction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may decline requests that conflict with legal obligations or open justice principles.</p>
