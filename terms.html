      <h2>5. Plans, access limits, and “Fair Usage”</h2>
      
      <h3>5.1 Plans and plan features</h3>
      <p>Your access depends on the Plan you purchase. [cite_start]Current Plans include[cite: 197, 198]:</p>
      <ul>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Free 7-day Preview:</strong> masked lawyer profiles; certain details locked[cite: 199].</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 One matter / one case restriction (30 Day Plan)</h3>
      <p>Where a Plan is limited to one matter/case, you will be required to enter case-related inputs. [cite_start]Once submitted, you <strong>cannot edit or replace</strong> the case inputs for that Plan[cite: 204, 206]. [cite_start]Attempts to circumvent this limitation may result in suspension[cite: 207].</p>
      <p>We may, at our sole discretion, allow a one-time correction for genuine data entry errors (e.g., typos) if reported within 24 hours. [cite_start]This is not a refund entitlement and does not allow changing the matter type to view different lawyers[cite: 209, 210].</p>

      <h3>5.3 Seat limits (Team)</h3>
      <p>If your Plan includes multiple seats, each seat must be used by a distinct individual. [cite_start]Sharing credentials across users is prohibited[cite: 211, 213].</p>

      <h3>5.4 Fair Usage</h3>

        <li><strong>Auto-renewal (Team):</strong> If your Team Plan is a recurring subscription, it may renew automatically unless you cancel. [cite_start]You authorize us and our partners to process recurring payments[cite: 222, 224].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle[cite: 226].</li>
        <li><strong>No refunds:</strong> Except where required by law, fees are non-refundable. [cite_start]We do not provide refunds for partial periods or unused usage[cite: 227].</li>
        [cite_start]<li><strong>Taxes (GST):</strong> Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes unless stated otherwise[cite: 228].</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Lawyer profiles and profile claims</h2>
